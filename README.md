# roboSim
Simulation to build a robot's guidance system in.

Currently in development stages.

Current Objectives: 

  Minor:  
    - Check setPosition() for issues with turning
  
  Major:  
    - Develop Guide() to pass a heading change to a modified Control()
    - Develop Navigate() to make calls to fake sensor functions, determine position, and pass state vector to Guide()
